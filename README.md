✨ _"Stop talking. Start grinding. Hit the saddle and crush your goals"_  

# 🚀 Hey, I'm Dario! 👋  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where I blend **Rust**, **edge computing**, and a dash of creativity to build tech that inspires and empowers. Whether you're here for a glimpse into my **open-source journey**, **networking rants**, or just curious about my **RC car experiments**, you've come to the right place.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Staff Engineer**, **YouTuber**, and passionate **problem-solver** currently based in Detroit. My mission is to create tools and platforms that push the boundaries of **autonomous vehicles**, **real-time streaming**, and **developer experiences**.

- 🌍 Trilingual: Fluent in **English**, **Spanish**, and **Rust** (😉).
- 🌱 Always learning: Protobuf optimizations, advanced networking, and Rust quirks.
- 💡 **Fun fact**: I once spent an entire weekend fine-tuning the controls of an RC car—only to realize the real challenge was explaining why debugging a DC motor felt more rewarding than mastering `ffmpeg`. Priorities, right?

## 🛠 What I Build

I’m focused on creating innovative solutions in **real-time streaming**, **edge computing**, and **autonomous mobility**. Check out some of my flagship projects:

- 🛻 [**May Mobility**](https://maymobility.com/)  
  May Mobility's autonomous vehicle technology surpasses the standard frameworks used by other AV companies by using a patented, real-time learning system that makes the best possible moment-by-moment driving decisions. With it, we’re bringing safe, accessible, autonomous rides to more places—whether urban, suburban or rural—anywhere your route takes you.

- 🎥 [**Videocall.rs**](https://videocall.rs)  
  Open-source teleconferencing built with **Rust**, **WebTransport**, and **HTTP/3**.
